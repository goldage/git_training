Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.

Test branching.

Now testing merging divergent branches.

Test rebasing.

Test updating the Dev Environment with remote changes (use the online tools offered by GitHub, to simulate someone else making changes to the remote while we work).

Make some conflict to test git pull (-r).
